# BioShake_3000-T_elm
BioShake 3000-T elm class for control of heater/shaker.

# Current State:
Currently tests a majority of the BioShake 3000-T elm's functionality, including shaking at a specified rpm, setting/changing/holding the temperature in degrees C, etc.

# Commands Overview:
  - # Initialization:
    - info: returns a list of general information
    - getVersion: returns the current firmware version number
    - getDescription: returns the current model information
    - resetDevice: restarts the controller (this takes about 30 sec)
    - getErrorList: returns a semicolon-separated list with errors and warnings that occurred during processing
    - enableCLED: permanent activation of the LED indication lights (the instrument will reset after this command)
    - disableCLED: permanent deactivation of the LED indication light (the instrument will reset after this command)
  - # ECO mode:
    - setEcoMode: switches the shaker into economical mode, reducing electricity consumption by deactivating the solenoid for the homing position and deactivation of the ELM function
    - leaveEcoMode: leaves the economical mode and switches into the normal operating state
  - # Shaking & Homing zero position control:
    - shakeOn: starts the shaking with the current mixing speed
    - shakeOnWithRuntime: starts the shaking with the current mixing speed for a defined time in seconds
    - getShakeRemainingTime: returns the remaining time in seconds of a single program
    - shakeOff: stops the shaking, proceeds to the homing position and locks in place
    - shakeOffWithDeenergizeSolenoid: stops the shaking, proceeds to the homing position, locks in place for 1 sec, then unlock zero position
    - shakeGoHome: shaker moves to the homing zero position and locks in place
    - shakeOffNonZeroPos: fast and safe stopping of all movements
    - shakeEmergencyOff:  fast and safe stopping of all movements

      - value ESTOP Emergency stop
    - getShakeZPV: returns the state of zero position and the coded voltage
    - getShakeTargetSpeed: returns the target mixing speed
    - setShakeTargetSpeed: sets the target mixing speed
    - getShakeActualSpeed: returns the current mixing speed
    - getShakeMinRpm: returns the minimum setting point, depends on specification
    - getShakeMaxRpm: returns the maximum setting point, depends on specification
    - getShakeAcceleration: returns the acceleration/deceleration value
    - setShakeAcceleration: sets the acceleration/deceleration value in seconds
    - getShakeAccelerationMin: get minimum acceleration/deceleration time in seconds
    - getShakeAccelerationMax: get maximum acceleration/deceleration time in seconds
  - # Temperature control:
    - tempOn: activates the temperature control and starts heating/cooling
    - tempOff: switches off the temperature control and stops heating/cooling
    - getTempState: returns the state of the temperature function
      - value 0 Temperature control is disabled
      - value 1 Temperature control is enabled
    - getTempStateAsString: returns the state of the temperature function as a string
      - value off Temperature control is disabled
      - value on Temperature control is enabled
    - getTempTarget: returns the target temperature
    - setTempTarget: sets the target temperature in 1/10 degrees C between 0 and 99 degrees C
    - getTempActual: returns the current temperature
    - getTempMin: returns the minimum of temperature set point (0 C)
    - getTempMax: returns the maximum of temperature set point (99 C)
    - getTemp40Calibr: returns the actual offset value on the calibration point at 40 C
    - setTemp40Calibr: set the offset value on the calibration point at 40 C
    - getTemp90Calibr: returns the actual offset value on the calibration point at 90 C
    - setTemp90Calibr: set the offset value on the calibration point at 90 C
  - # ELM control
    - setElmLockPos: closes the ELM
    - setElmUnlockPos: opens the ELM for gripping microplates
    - getElmState: returns the state of the ELM
      - value 0 ELM nor in lock or unlock position
      - value 1 ELM lock poition - Microplate is locked
